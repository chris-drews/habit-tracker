# habit-tracker

habit-tracker is a small app that can be used to keep track of a number of habits over time by using the concept of streaks.

## Installation

Download all the files of the app and make sure to have them in the same folder.

When using the app for the first time, the database for habits to be stored in will be created automatically.

This database comes with pre-existing sample data.

## Usage

To start the app, run HabitTracker.py.

This will start up the home page of the app.

Here, the various commands you can input, will be listed and briefly explained.

The program runs as a loop, so after typing in a command, you will get the answer for that command and then be able to input the next one.

For some commands, you will need to clarify the specific habit you are referring to. To simplify this, the habits are listed at the beginning of the page with numbers next to them. This way you can type in the numbers instead of writing out the full habit name.

## Examples

To exit the app you type in "exit".

To get to the statistics page (where you can access additional commands) you type in "stats".

Given the following habits:
1. Go for a walk
2. Take a shower
3. Drink 2 liters of water

To get a statistical overview about the habit "Go for a walk", type in "ov 1".
